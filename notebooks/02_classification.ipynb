    "The goal of this notebook is to classify examples into different categories, specifically identifying spam vs. non-spam emails using a generated dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "Instead of using a pre-existing dataset, we generate a synthetic dataset of ham and spam emails. Each email is saved as an individual text file in respective `ham` and `spam` directories. This approach ensures flexibility and control over the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate Dataset\n",
    "Before starting, we generate the spam and ham datasets."
